# PiCRT

An extension of https://github.com/lanceseidman/PiCAST

Use your android phone to cast youtube videos/twitch streams to a raspberry pi.

Install PiCAST on the Raspberry Pi, replace the picast.js file with the one provided, and run picast_start.sh.
Install the app, and from youtube or twitch, share to PiCRT app. 

Requirements:
VLC player
youtube-dl ver. 2017 or later
livestreamer ver. 1.12 or later

Can play youtube videos (including protected videos), and twitch streams. 

This was designed to play on a small CRT, so the resolutions of the streams is rather low. You can change these in the picast.js.
